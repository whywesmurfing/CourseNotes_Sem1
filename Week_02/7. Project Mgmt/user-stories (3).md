### Application: Time for Walkies
A client wants a web application for her dog walking service. She has been walking dogs as a service in her local neighbourhood for 5 years, and wants an application to help her manage her dog walking appointments. She wants customers to be able to see her availability and submit a form to request her service on particular days and times.


#### Provide at least 6 user stories for the Time for Walkies application in the space below using the template: 

“As a dog walker, I [want to] see a calendar of all their appointments, [so that] they can view which owner to approach and which dog she will be walking.”
“As a customer, I [want to] have a profile of my dog and the history of the walks, [so that] I keep track of how many times I have used the service.”
“As a customer, I [want to] have a calendar of all the availabilities of my dog walker, [so that] I know when I can plan for my next appointment and block out the time specified.”
“As a customer, I [want to] be notified on my phone when the appointment starts and ends, [so that] I know when to be home to hand over my pet or pick up my pet from the dog walker.”
“As a dog walker, I [want to] know how much I am charging per appointment, [so that] I can remember what customers are charged and they are charged differently.”
“As a dog walker, I [want to] send reminders to dog owners on the next time they should walk their dog, [so that] customers will be reminded on when they should walk their dog next and use my services if they need to.”
